# basic-k8s-ctrl
This is a simple Kubernetes CRD and controller for reconciling k8s Job and CronJob resources with 1 abstract interface.

## Description
The ClusterScan CRD acts as a common interface for submitting both one-off and scheduled jobs to a Kubernetes cluster.

The ClusterScan Spec incldues data such as Job Spec, Schedule and Job Type. The ClusterScan Status captures metadata such as number of successfull and failed Job runs, JobConditions and more.

The reconciler loop consists of 2 workflows - 1 for each type of job. 
- The Job reconciler either submits the new Job to the cluster, or updates ClusterScan status to succeeded or failed - depending on the outcome of the submitted job.
- The CronJob reconciler either creates the scheduled jobs on the cluster, or updates ClusterScan with the results of the last execution. This includes appending the JobCondition, updating LastExecutionDetails and incrementing the Success and Failure counters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/basic-k8s-ctrl:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/basic-k8s-ctrl:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/basic-k8s-ctrl:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/basic-k8s-ctrl/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
